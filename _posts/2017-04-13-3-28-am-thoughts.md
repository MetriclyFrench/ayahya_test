For some reason, I am unable to sleep... Thought doing a bit of work on this site and maybe working on a post will help me get to sleep. Markdown and Liquid are both still unfamiliar to me, so please excuse this site/post's bland look.

Setting this static site up using AWS S3, SNS, and SQS is a something I am proud of. It proves to me that I am making progress. I had entirely too much help and guidance from the internet, still it was something I taught myself. I didn't go to class or attend lectures to learn this. I did the research and taught myself. For some reason, I learn a lot more outside of classrooms and under teacher/parent supervision. Well, actually it isn't 'for some reason'. I know it is because outside of those provisions, I only read/spend time on things that interest me. But, even compared to my major classes... I perform and understand a lot more outside of those. It could be because I hate when people tell me to do things... Even if those things are things I enjoy doing... I don't really understand.

That's all for tonight. I'll try and get some sleep.

P.S. I love the 'materialshell-oceanic' theme for my ZSH shell. Here's a link to it https://materialshell.carloscuesta.me
